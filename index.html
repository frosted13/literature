          climactic moment of catharsis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> The witches' paradoxical statement suggesting the inversion

          Macbeth false confidence but contains a fatal loophole.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Example of equivocation (ambiguous language), explores
          fate vs free will, relates to contemporary debate on equivocation,
          creates dramatic irony (audience learns the truth before Macbeth),

          with threatening elements, emphasizes Victorian propriety and modesty
          ("well gloved"), reflects aesthetic preference for delicate femininity,

        </p>
      </div>

          danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Creates tension while maintaining femininity (fearlessness
          would be "unwomanly"), reflects Victorian belief that nervousness was
          feminine, allows her to participate while conforming to norms, makes her
          relatable. Shows how Conan Doyle navigates gender ideals between Gothic
          heroines and "New Woman."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Reveals his complex moral position (criminal/victim),

          Victorian legal/moral distinctions (murder vs self-defense), presents
          colonial India as morally corrupting, introduces class critique.
          Introduces moral relativism to the detective format.

          socialist message of collective responsibility.
        </p>

          capitalism (Birling's view), inclusive language ("we") breaks class
          barriers, anticipates post-war welfare state/NHS (written 1945, set
          1912), harm to one affects all (Eva Smith), Goole as Priestley's

      <div class="quote">"It's better to ask for the earth than to take it"</div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Statement defending workers' rights to demand better
          conditions (ask) and critiquing capitalist exploitation (take).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Counters Birling's view of strikers, validates Eva Smith's
          action, reflects Priestley's socialist sympathies, written after WWII
          (strengthening labor rights), contrasts Goole's plain speaking with
          Birlings' euphemisms, distillation of ethical principles. Connects to
          1940s union power and Labour victory.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> The Inspector's ominous prophecy warning of violent
          consequences if society doesn't embrace collective responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Concludes final speech, uses biblical/apocalyptic
          language, dramatic irony for audiences (WWI & WWII experienced), "fire"
          evokes war/hell, makes moral message unavoidable climax, transforms Eva's
          tragedy into social warning, structural tension leading to final revelation.

      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Birling's declaration of his individualistic,
          capitalist philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Embodies the play's critique of selfish individualism,
          gendered phrasing reflects patriarchal worldview, directly contrasts
          Inspector's collective responsibility message, represents pre-war
          mentality (written 1945, set 1912), led to social inequality (Eva
          Smith's exploitation), references real historical figures showing
          aspirational snobbery.

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Birling's confident, ironically incorrect assertion about
          the Titanic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Dramatic irony undermines Birling's credibility immediately,
          historical reference obvious to audience, represents his shortsightedness
          and inability to see danger/consequences, prepares audience to question
          his other statements (war, labor), Titanic symbolizes vulnerability of
          Birling's reputation and social order.

          progressive ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Reveals his dismissive attitude towards social change,
          establishes generational conflict (outdated vs progressive values),
          foreshadows conflict with Eric/Sheila, resonates with post-WWII
          tensions between generations, structural device showing resistance to
          moral growth. Reveals his fundamental resistance to change and
          self-reflection.

          classism and lack of empathy for working-class women.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Dehumanizing language enables moral disengagement,
          "that" creates linguistic distance, shows how class prejudice affects
          her charity work (institutional power), blinds her to Eric's involvement
          (dramatic irony), reveals intersection of class/gender hierarchies, shows
          moral hypocrisy (different standard for Gerald), exemplifies language
          enabling exploitation.

          her actions concerning Eva Smith.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Represents moral blindness of privileged classes, shows
          lack of self-awareness/ethical reflection, contrasts with Sheila's
          acceptance (generational divide), hypocrisy given her charity role,
          defense based on following procedures ("did my duty"), embodies rigid
          class attitudes Priestley critiques.

          the unknown father of Eva Smith's child, who turns out to be her son Eric.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Creates dramatic tension and irony (audience knows before
          she does), emphasizes paternal responsibility while she denies her own,
          represents intersection of public morality and private hypocrisy,
          intensifies critique of upper-class hypocrisy, statement boomerangs back
          on her family, forces her to confront contradictory standards.

          <strong>Context:</strong> Establishes Sheila as morally educable, directly humanizes
          workers (counters capitalist reduction), shows recognition of individuals
          (vs mother's "that class"), moral awakening after admitting her role,

          emphasizes serious ethical implications, indicates genuine moral concern
          (not just social embarrassment), establishes generational divide (Sheila
          accepts responsibility), represents completed moral journey, her fear

          remorse for her actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Establishes her capacity for moral growth (contrasting
          parents), first family member to respond appropriately, willingness to
          face uncomfortable truths sets her apart, marks beginning of transformation
          from spoiled child, language lacks euphemisms (direct), shows how privilege
          enabled casual cruelty. Raises expectations for others' responses.

          them trustworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Shows Gerald’s upper-class attitude and belief that rich people can’t be guilty.
          Priestley uses this to highlight the arrogance of the elite and their refusal to accept blame, even when their

          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong> Shows the imbalance in their relationship. Gerald is honest, but still downplays the

          shift and hope for change, repetition shows newfound confidence, maintains
          responsibility even if Inspector fraudulent (genuine growth), redirects
          shame onto parents, links to socialist message of rejecting established

          identity, focuses on moral essence (harm caused), clarity emerges despite
          marginalized position, alongside Sheila creates concluding moral division,
          prioritizes actions/consequences over intentions, simplicity suggests
